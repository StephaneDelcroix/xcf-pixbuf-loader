THIS IS AN OLD PIECE OF SOFTWARE. PROBABLY NOT USED ANYWHERE ANYMORE.

io-xcf is a gdk-pixbuf loader for the xcf (The Gimp) files.

build it using make, cp the .so next to the other gdk-pixbuf loaders on your 
machine, and run gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders

test it with eog (works with 2.24.1) of f-spot (SVN)
